## Response Code

After sending an API request, you will receive a response with the following codes and headers, which indicate the status of your request:

| Code |      Status       |                                                     Description                                                      |

## Response format

All API responses from the Data Catalogue API are returned in JSON format. Below is an example of the structure of the response format:

```JSON
{
    meta: {...},
    data: {...}
}
```

The response consists of two main elements:

- `meta` - This element contains lightweight meta information, providing details about the requested resource.
- `data` - This element represents the requested resource, which may include additional information based on the provided query parameters.
  It's important to note that while the meta element provides essential information about the resource, there is also a separate endpoint available to retrieve more detailed information. You can access this endpoint [here](TODO: add link here).

We provide the OpenAPI in JSON format to ensure ease of use and compatibility with a wide range of programming languages and applications. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please feel free to contact us.
