## Response format

All API responses from the Data Catalogue API are returned in JSON format. Below is an example of the structure of the response format:

```JSON
{
    meta: {...},
    data: {...}
}
```

The response consists of two main elements:

- `meta` - lightweight meta information about the requested resource.
- `data` - this element represents the requested resource, which may include additional information based on the provided query parameters.
