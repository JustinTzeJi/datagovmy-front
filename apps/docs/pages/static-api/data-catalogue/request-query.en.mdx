## Query Parameters

The Data Catalogue API supports several query parameters. The following table provides information about the available query parameters, their data types, and whether they are required:

| Parameter | Type      | Required | Description                                                            |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id        | `string`  | Yes      | Indicates the specific resource requested.                             |
| filter    | `string`  | No       | Indicates filter(s) of the data.                                       |
| limit     | `integer` | No       | Indicates the maximum number of responses to return.                   |
| sort      | `string`  | No       | Indicates the order of the response, in ascending or descending order. |
| include   | `string`  | No       | Indicates the columns to include in the response.                      |
| exclude   | `string`  | No       | Indicates the columns to exclude from the response.                    |
| start     | `date`    | No       | Indicates the start date range (only if `date` is available).          |
| end       | `date`    | No       | Indicates the end date range (only if `date` is available).            |

Please note that the `filter` parameter is used for row-level filtering, while `include`/`exclude` parameters are used for column-level filtering.

## Query Syntax

When working with the OpenAPI, you can define query parameters by appending a question mark (`?`) after the base URL. Query parameters consist of a key-value pair, where the key and value are separated by an equal sign (`=`). If there are multiple parameters, they are separated by an ampersand (`&`).

### `filter`

The `filter` parameter allows you to refine your API request by applying specific filters to the data. There are 2 different supported formats:

#### String Equal filter

```
value@column
```

- This format filters the data based on an exact string match.
- The `value` represents the desired string value within the `column`.
- The `column` denotes the column or field to be filtered.
- `filter=John@name` retrieves data where the value of the "name" column is "John".

#### Range Filter

```
column[begin:end]
```

- This format filters the data within a specified numeric range.
- The `column` specifies the column or field to be filtered.
- The `begin` and `end` values define the numeric range.
- `filter=age[18:30]` retrieves data where the value of the `age` column falls between 18 and 30 (inclusive).

### `sort`

```
sort=<sort_val>
```

- `<sort_val>` specifies the sorting criteria in the format `field@order`.
- `field` represents the column or field by which to sort.
- `order` can be either `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).
- `sort=name@asc` sorts the results by the "name" column in ascending order.

### `include` and `exclude`

The `include` and `exclude` parameters allow you to selectively include or exclude specific columns or fields from the returned results.

```
include=<column1,column2,...>
exclude=<column1,column2,...>
```

- `<column1, column2, ...>` specifies the columns or fields to be included or excluded.
- Multiple columns can be separated by commas.
- `include=name,age` includes only the "name" and "age" columns in the results.

### `start` and `end`

The `start` and `end` parameters allow you to filter the data based on a specific date range.

```
start=<start_date>
end=<end_date>
```

- `<start_date>` and `<end_date>` represent the start and end dates of the desired date range.
- The dates must be in a format compatible with the data being queried.
- The data will be filtered to include dates greater than or equal to `<start_date>` and less than or equal to `<end_date>`.
- `start=2022-01-01&end=2022-12-31` filters the results to include data from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
