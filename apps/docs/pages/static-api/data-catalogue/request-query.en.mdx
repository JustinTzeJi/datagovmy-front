## Query Parameters

The Data Catalogue API supports several query parameters.
The following table shows the available query parameters, their data types, and whether they are required:

- `id` - Indicates the specific resource requested
- `filter` - Indicates filter(s) of the data
- `limit` - Indicates response limit
- `sort` - Indicates order of the response, in ascending or descending order
- `include` - indicates keys to include
- `exclude` - indicates keys to exclude
- `start` - indicates date start range (only if date is available)
- `end` - indicates date end range (only if date is available)

Note: `filter` and `include`/`exclude` are different, such that `filter` is done on the row level, `include`/`exclude` on the column level.

Reserve characters are used as part of the query paramater.

- `filter:x@y` filters to include `x` values within column `y`
