## GTFS Realtime API Endpoint

<Head>
  <title>GTFS-R - Open API Docs</title>

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/<feed>/<agency>
```

### What does GTFS Realtime do?

GTFS Realtime is an extension of [GTFS Static](gtfs-static) that enables public transportation agencies to share live trip updates, service alerts and vehicle positions.
Currently, our GTFS Realtime API only offers vehicle position data. For more details on GTFS Realtime and its broader functionalities, please refer to https://gtfs.org/realtime/.

### Important note: We are building iteratively

_TODO: inform users that validation errors for each feed are included [below](#vehicle-position)?_

This is the first time that Malaysia has had an official and freely-usable GTFS API. It is the result of months of hard work and collaboration between the data.gov.my developer team and various public transport operators. It is by no means complete; there are plenty of services that will only be integrated over the coming months and years. However, with several primary services already included, we felt that it was time to push it live - so that the private sector and public transport community could begin building from it, and most crucially, giving us feedback on how to improve it.
If you have any feedback on the GTFS API, please write to us at data.dtsa@mampu.gov.my - we welcome any and all constructive feedback!

### Source of GTFS Realtime Data

The GTFS Realtime API incorporates data from various transport agencies in Malaysia. Currently, the following agencies contribute their transit data:

- [**myBAS Johor Bahru**](https://www.causewaylink.com.my/mybas/en/): A bus service operator in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, providing bus transportation on 19 routes across 5 corridors, including Kota Tinggi, Masai, Kulai, Gelang Patah, and Pontian.
- [**KTMB (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad)**](https://www.ktmb.com.my/): A railway operator providing train services across the country.
- [**Prasarana**](https://myrapid.com.my/): A public transport operator responsible for managing various modes of transportation, including LRT (Light Rail Transit), MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), monorail, and bus services.

### Request Query & Response Format

The GTFS Realtime API adheres to the standard GTFS Realtime protobuf format (`.proto`).
The detailed format is available in the [official GTFS Realtime reference](https://gtfs.org/realtime/proto/), and you can access the protobuf files through the following endpoints:

## Vehicle Position

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-position/<agency>
```

### Frequency of Data Update

- All Vehicle Position feeds are updated every **30 seconds**.

### myBAS Johor Bahru

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-position/mybas-johor
# .proto file is returned
```

- Errors:
  - [E003](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E003): GTFS-rt `trip_id` does not exist in GTFS data
    - Around 55% of trips are undefined in GTFS Static.
  - [E004](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E004): GTFS-rt `route_id` does not exist in GTFS data
    - Around 15% of the routes are undefined in GTFS Static.
  - [E023](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E023) - trip `start_time` does not match first GTFS `arrival_time`
    - `start_time` is invalidly provided - requires agency to fix in future.
  - [E028](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E028) - Vehicle position outside agency coverage area
    - acknowledged

### KTMB

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-position/ktmb
# .proto file is returned
```

### Prasarana

```http
GET https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-position/prasarana?category=<category>
# .proto file is returned
```

- The possible `<category>` values are `rkl` , `rapid-bus-kuantan` and `rapid-bus-penang`.
- Errors:
  - [E003](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E003): GTFS-rt `trip_id` does not exist in GTFS data
  - [E004](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E004): GTFS-rt `route_id` does not exist in GTFS data
- _Note: Above errors are due to existing system that cannot support tracking trips and routes properly. Will need a full reform to make the feed meaningful and compliant._

### Understanding the data

To properly parse the protobuf data, refer to the [official GTFS Realtime language bindings](https://gtfs.org/realtime/language-bindings/)
for guidance on decoding the information.
Below is a concise Python example illustrating how to read RapidKL vehicle position data from the GTFS Realtime API:

```python
# pip install gtfs-realtime-bindings pandas requests
from google.transit import gtfs_realtime_pb2
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict
import pandas as pd
from requests import get

# Sample GTFS-R URL from Malaysia's Open API
URL = 'https://api.data.gov.my/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-position/prasarana?category=rkl'

# Parse the GTFS Realtime feed
feed = gtfs_realtime_pb2.FeedMessage()
response = get(URL)
feed.ParseFromString(response.content)

# Extract and print vehicle position information
vehicle_positions = [MessageToDict(entity.vehicle) for entity in feed.entity]
print(f'Total vehicles: {len(vehicle_positions)}')
df = pd.json_normalize(vehicle_positions)
print(df)
```
