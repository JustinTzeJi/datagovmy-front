## Throttling Rate

To ensure fair usage and maintain system performance, OpenAPI enforces throttling limits on the number of requests that can be made within a specific timeframe. If the limit is exceeded, subsequent requests will fail, and you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error in your responses.

The following table outlines the throttling limits for different APIs within OpenAPI:

| API            | API Token Required | Throttling Limit       |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Data Catalogue | No                 | 4 requests per minute  |
| Data Catalogue | Yes                | 10 requests per minute |
| GTFS-Static    | No                 | 4 requests per minute  |
| GTFS-Static    | Yes                | 10 requests per minute |

Please note that the throttling limits vary based on whether you are using an API token or not. If you anticipate exceeding the throttling limits without an API token, we recommend requesting an API token as mentioned in the previous section.

It is essential to manage your requests within the specified throttling limits to ensure uninterrupted access to the OpenAPI. If you have any questions or require further assistance regarding throttling or rate limits, please reach out to our support team.
